# Sell and Hold

This repo is about analyzing the Sell and Hold market strategy, explained in detail at TBD. It is used to produce the analysis presented in that article.

To execute the simulation, run:

`perl
perl sell_and_hold.pl
`

Simulation (and strategy) paramters are defined and explained at the top of that file. In addition, it can take some command line arugments which are currently used by sensitivity.pl to assist with quicker sensisitivy analysis. To see an example of that, run:

`perl
perl sensitivity.pl
`

The data that the simulation draws on lives in data/. Enjoy! Pull requests are welcome.
